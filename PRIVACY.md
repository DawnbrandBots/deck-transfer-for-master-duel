# Deck transfer for Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel and Neuron, privacy policy

Deck transfer for Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel and Neuron does not collect any data
about your use of extension.

The official database created by Konami Digital Entertainment is https://www.db.yugioh-card.com/yugiohdb/.
This extension requires access to the deck pages of the official database in
order to inject import buttons into the edit deck pages. When you click on any
of these buttons, if you provided a valid deck, a network request is made to the
[YGOPRODECK API](https://ygoprodeck.com/api-guide/) with the passwords of the
cards in your deck. This is to fetch the names of the cards in your deck,
since YDK files and YDKE URLs only contain card passwords.
This extension also requires access to YGOPRODECK in order to set up a partner
integration to more conveniently transfer decks from YGOPRODECK to the official database.
