[Import](#importing) and [export](#exporting) Yu-Gi-Oh! decks from Master Duel and Neuron in YDK format and YDKE URLs via Konami's official card database.
Directly import decks from [YGOPRODECK](https://ygoprodeck.com) and other communities.

Konami's official products have never interoperated with community resources,
but now with this browser extension, you can bring your decks in commonly-used
deck formats directly into the official [Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel](https://www.konami.com/yugioh/masterduel/) video game
and [Neuron duel assistant phone app](https://www.konami.com/yugioh/neuron/en/).
You can also [download any deck](#downloading-public-decks) from the official card database, including your
Master Duel and Neuron decks, and share directly to YGOPRODECK.

**Note**: Opera approves extension updates slower than the Chrome Web Store so far. Opera users may receive new features
and fixes faster by installing from the Chrome Web Store instead.

1. Use the buttons to export and download the deck.

Note: if you choose a deck containing cards not yet released in the current language region (e.g. OCG-only cards while viewing in English),
those cards will be missing from the display and the exports. In this case, try switching the database language using the
language select is in the top-right corner (e.g. switch to Japanese for OCG-only cards).

those cards will be missing from the display and the exports. In this case, try switching the database language using the
language select is in the top-right corner (e.g. switch to Japanese).

## Linking Master Duel to the official database

Link your Master Duel account to a Konami ID via the data transfer feature.
This is found in the hamburger menu as "Data Transfer", or "Data Transfer" in the title screen.

![Title screen](./docs/title-screen.jpg "Title screen on PlayStation 5")

![Menu item](./docs/data-transfer-menu.jpg "Menu item on PlayStation 5")

Follow the instructions to create or log in with your Konami ID.
Your Konami ID must be associated with a Card Game ID.

After data transfer is set up, the card database button in the top-right of the deck screen should show the decks from your official database account.
Furthermore, you should see the export button become available when you view your decks.
Make sure you can log into [Konami's official card database](https://www.db.yugioh-card.com/yugiohdb/?request_locale=en)
and access "My Deck" on the website.

If your Konami ID does not have a Card Game ID, you can try logging into your Konami ID in Neuron.

## Installing on Safari

1. Install [Userscripts](https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1463298887) from the App Store.

## Installing on Android

Unfortunately, most Android browsers do not support extensions.

Firefox Beta supports installing extensions beyond the recommended list. If you are interested,
you can follow the same instructions as [Indie Wiki Buddy](https://getindie.wiki/firefox-mobile/?utm_source=dawnbrand)
to set up. You can either create your own collection or use
collection owner [`17816848`](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-CA/firefox/collections/17816848/deck-transfer-for-master-duel/)
and collection name `deck-transfer-for-master-duel`.

Kiwi Browser supports Chrome extensions, but I have not tested or used this browser.
